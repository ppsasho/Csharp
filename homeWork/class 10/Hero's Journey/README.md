# Hero's Journey ⚔

## Log in the Game 🛡

As you begin your journey in the game, you will log in using your email and password. The system is designed to recognize your credentials, ensuring a secure entry every time. Simply enter your username and password, and if they match our records, you’ll be welcomed into the game. 

Rest assured, the system validates your email format and matches it with the correct password. If you happen to make a mistake, you'll have multiple chances to try again. However, after five unsuccessful attempts, the application will close to protect your account.

## Create a Character 🗡

Once logged in, it's time to create your hero! You'll start by choosing a name that represents your character—just make sure it’s between 2 and 20 characters long. Next, you'll select from one of three unique races:

1. **Dwarf**: Strong and resilient with high health.
2. **Elf**: Agile and swift, perfect for those who value speed.
3. **Human**: Balanced with a mix of health, strength, and agility.

After selecting a race, you’ll choose a class to further define your character’s strengths:

1. **Warrior**: Increases health but reduces agility.
2. **Rogue**: Sacrifices health for greater agility.
3. **Mage**: Boosts health at the cost of strength.

Once your choices are made, you’ll receive a summary of your character, complete with their name, race, class, and vital stats. Your hero is now ready to embark on their journey!

## Gameplay 🏹

Your hero must face five challenging events to win the game. Each event is a test of strength, agility, and decision-making. As you encounter these events, you’ll be given the choice to either:

1. **Fight**: Test your strength against the odds.
2. **Run Away**: Rely on your agility to escape danger.

Every decision matters—each event can impact your hero’s health. If your health falls to zero, the game will end with a message of defeat, but you’ll have the option to start a new adventure. Survive all five events, and you’ll emerge victorious!

**Events**:
1. **Bandits attack you out of nowhere. They seem very dangerous...**
   - -20 health
2. **You bump into one of the guards of the nearby village. They attack you without warning...**
   - -30 health
3. **A Land Shark appears. It starts chasing you down to eat you...**
   - -50 health
4. **You accidentally step on a rat. Its friends are not happy. They attack...**
   - -10 health
5. **You find a huge rock. It comes alive somehow and tries to smash you...**
   - -30 health

At the end of your journey, if your hero still stands strong, you’ll celebrate a well-earned victory. If not, don’t worry—you can always start a new game and try again. Good luck, brave hero!
